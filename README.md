# One-Click
Chrome Extension

One-Click is a chrome extension I built to simplify signing in for a company. Instead of you having to click and login using the credentials you just click the extension and it will copy the credentials and attempt to login for you.
This cuts about 30-40 seconds of time for an employee doing this type of work.
